**NOTE** Not finished, not for production use

[![CI](https://github.com/widhalmt/ansible-role-ca/workflows/Molecule%20Test/badge.svg?event=push)](https://github.com/widhalmt/ansible-role-ca/workflows/Molecule%20Test/badge.svg)

A simple role to create a CA to create certificates and deploy them to hosts.

The intended use is to create certificates you can use for connecting clients to main systems.

The current version is only tested with CentOS 7 and Rocky 8.

Some files are copied to the host you're running Ansible on.

## Requirements ##

You need to have the Python library `cryptography` in version `>1.2.3` available. `PyOpenSSL` might also work, but is deprecated. Please note that different versions might have different requirements which ciphers to use. So watch your Playbook output and be ready to change `ca_openssl_cipher` if needed.

## Variables ##

* `ca_manage_openssl`: Install `openssl` package? (default: `true`)
* `ca_ca_dir`: Directory to place CA and certificates (default: `/opt/ca`)
* `ca_ca_days`: Runtime of the CA certificate (default: `3650`)
* `ca_ca_password`: Password of CA key (default: `ChangeMe`)
* `ca_localdir`: Temporary directory on Ansible management host (default: `/tmp/ca`)
* `ca_local_become`: Use `become` on the Ansible controller. Used for creation of `ca_localdir`. (default: `false`)
* `ca_ca_host`: Hostname of the CA host (default: `localhost`)

* `ca_common_name`: CN for certificates (default: `{{ inventory_hostname }}`)
* `ca_email`: E-Mail address for certificates (default: `root@{{ ansible_fqdn }}`)
* `ca_altname_1`: First alt name (default: `{{ ansible_fqdn }}`)
* `ca_ca_keylength`: CA keylength (default: `2048`)
* `ca_server_cert`: Create server certificate as well (default: `true`)
* `ca_logstash`: Create Logstash compatible certificate as well. Needs `ca_server_cert` to be set. (default: `false`)
